	<h1> Introduction to Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity is a measure of the computational complexity of an algorithm, which is the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the size of the input. Itâ€™s a way to quantify the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, usually expressed as a function of the size of the input, typically measured in terms of the number of items being processed.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to solve a problem. It measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses, expressed in terms of the size of the input. The space complexity is important because it determines the scalability of a solution and the ability of a program to handle large amounts of data.</b></p>
